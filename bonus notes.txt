some fun artifacts!
>video has blue gamma broken cause OBS used a colorspace that isn't supported by ANYTHING so you get wonderful inverted colors (but only sometimes)
>the code does work, but the default page must be accessed through localhost:8080/login, as auto-redirecting to this page will ALWAYS DO IT FOR SOME REASON.
>there's bugs. a lot of them. don't look too closely or you'll find bugs all over (like the mobile UI schema we don't talk about.)
>this taught me a lot about how webpages work!! if i had a do-over i'd use laravel instead of pug as my webpage framework, and i'd properly connect prisma to NAVIDROME's db.
